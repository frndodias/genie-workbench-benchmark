# Genie Workbench

Genie Workbench is a Databricks App for creating, scoring, and optimizing Databricks Genie Agents. It combines a FastAPI backend, React/Vite frontend, Databricks On-Behalf-Of auth, Lakebase persistence, and the Genie Space Optimizer (GSO) benchmark pipeline.

Use it to:

- Create Genie Agents from business requirements and Unity Catalog data sources
- Score Genie Agent quality with an instant rule-based IQ scan
- Run benchmark-driven optimization through the Auto-Optimize pipeline
- Evaluate benchmarks on demand and reclassify false negatives, without a full optimization run
- Track scan history, starred spaces, sessions, and optimization state

## Quick Start

The recommended install path is the Databricks notebook installer.

### Databricks Notebook Installer

1. Clone this repo into a Databricks Git folder.
2. Open `notebooks/install.py`.
3. Attach a Serverless compute session (environment v5).
4. Set the notebook widgets:
   - `app_name`
   - `catalog`
   - `warehouse_id`
   - `lakebase_mode` (`create` / `existing` / `skip`)
   - `lakebase_project_name`
5. Run the notebook from the top.

The notebook uses notebook-native `WorkspaceClient()` auth, creates a generated deployment source folder under `/Workspace/Users/<you>/.genie-workbench-deploy/<app-name>/app`, patches `app.yaml` there, provisions UC/Lakebase/GSO resources, and deploys the Databricks App from that generated source. The Git folder remains unchanged.

For widget details, prerequisites, Lakebase behavior, updates, and troubleshooting, see [the Deployment Guide](docs/docs/getting-started/deployment-guide.md).

### Local Terminal Installer

The local terminal path is still supported for users who want CLI-based deployment:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd databricks-genie-workbench
databricks auth login --profile <workspace-profile>
./scripts/install.sh
```

For subsequent local terminal updates:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --update
```

Do not run `databricks bundle init`; this project already has its bundle configuration.

## Benchmark (on-demand evaluation)

A dedicated **Benchmark** tab runs a Genie Agent's benchmark evaluation on demand — without the full Auto-Optimize run. It executes the native Genie Eval-Run and then reclassifies **false negatives** (an answer marked BAD whose data is actually equivalent to the expected result → GOOD) through a cascade:

1. **Exact SQL set-diff** (`EXCEPT ALL` both directions) — full-precision, column-position based, robust to column-name differences and entity/value swaps.
2. **Numeric-multiset** — same numbers regardless of shape/order (handles transposed/reshaped results). Runs unbounded on the engine, so the verdict is never decided on a truncated sample.
3. **LLM review** — uses each benchmark's `evaluation_note` as the grading rubric to judge semantic equivalence.

Everything runs as a Databricks job and persists to `<catalog>.<schema>.benchmark_runs` and `benchmark_results`, with a per-question drill-down in the app (native vs. adjusted accuracy, verdict + who decided it, generated vs. expected SQL and the underlying data). Result tables are created by the job on first run. The installer (both the notebook and local terminal paths) provisions the `benchmark-eval` job automatically and injects `BENCHMARK_JOB_ID` into `app.yaml` — no extra setup.

## Demo Data

If you do not have a dataset ready, `notebooks/demo-data/` includes standalone Databricks notebooks that generate synthetic Unity Catalog datasets for banking, healthcare, retail, SaaS churn, talent advisory, and wind turbine maintenance demos. See [notebooks/demo-data/README.md](notebooks/demo-data/README.md) for the available schemas, configuration variables, and permissions.

## Prerequisites

Notebook installer:

- Databricks workspace with Apps enabled
- SQL Warehouse
- Unity Catalog with permission to create the GSO schema
- Repo cloned into a Databricks Git folder
- Databricks compute that can run `%pip install`

Local terminal installer additionally requires:

- Databricks CLI v0.297.2+
- Python 3.11+
- uv
- Node.js and npm

Lakebase is optional, but without it scan history, starred spaces, and agent sessions are stored in memory only.

### Installer permissions

The installer creates a Databricks App, UC schema/volume/tables, a Lakebase Autoscaling project, an optional MLflow experiment, and a Jobs-managed optimization job, and grants the app's service principal across all of them. **Most installers will need workspace-admin equivalents.** At minimum, the installer needs:

- Apps create entitlement and `CAN_MANAGE` on the resulting app
- `CAN_USE` on the SQL warehouse
- `USE CATALOG` + `CREATE SCHEMA` on the target catalog (and ownership / `MANAGE` to grant the SP)
- Lakebase Autoscaling project creation and ownership (to create the Postgres role and run database `GRANT`s)
- Workspace files write for `databricks sync` and the MLflow experiment path
- Jobs create entitlement and `CAN_MANAGE` on the GSO job
- `CAN_MANAGE` on any Genie Agents being granted to the app SP (optional step)

For the full entitlement list, see [Installer permissions](docs/docs/getting-started/deployment-guide.md#installer-permissions) and [Authentication & Permissions](docs/docs/platform/authentication.md).

## Documentation

Start with the [Introduction](docs/docs/getting-started/introduction.md); the canonical documentation is the Docusaurus site under [`docs/docs/`](docs/docs/).

- [Deployment Guide](docs/docs/getting-started/deployment-guide.md): notebook and local installer flows, Lakebase setup, updates, teardown
- [Architecture Overview](docs/docs/getting-started/architecture-overview.md): backend, frontend, persistence, deployment design
- [Authentication & Permissions](docs/docs/platform/authentication.md): OBO vs service principal behavior and required grants
- [Auto-Optimize](docs/docs/features/auto-optimize.md): GSO optimization pipeline
- [Operations Guide](docs/docs/platform/operations.md): Lakebase, MLflow, app logs, GSO job operations

- [Environment Variables](docs/docs/reference/environment-variables.md): `app.yaml`, `.env.deploy`, and notebook widget variable flow

## Development Notes

This app runs only on Databricks Apps. Do not run a local `uvicorn` server for app testing; OBO auth, Lakebase, app resources, and serving endpoints are Databricks-managed runtime dependencies.

Dependency lock files are the source of truth and should be committed when changed:

- `uv.lock`
- `frontend/package-lock.json`

Do not edit `requirements.txt` manually. It is generated from `uv.lock` and excluded from Databricks App deployment so the platform uses `uv sync` from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
